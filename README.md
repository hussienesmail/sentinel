## Connectors

### @heimdall-sdk/express

We also provide an Express middleware package to easily integrate Sentinel monitoring into your Node.js applications.

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @heimdall-sdk/express
```

Check the most recent version on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heimdall-sdk/express) and update the command accordingly.

Then, use it in your Express application:

```typescript
import { heimdall } from "@heimdall-sdk/express";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  heimdall({
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
    serviceName: "my-company-api",
    apiKey: "heim_XXXX", // Replace with your actual API key generated from Sentinel
    flushIntervalMs: 10_000, // Optional: default is 10,000 ms
    flushSize: 50, // Optional: default is 50
  })
);

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "hello world" });
});

const PORT = 3001;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
